# Overly Orange Website

This is the website theme for JohnnyMatthews.dev. It's quite orange. Sorry about that. This repository is spilt into two main parts:

- The HTML
- The style sheets

The HTML just contains some boilerplate code to show as an example of what this style is all about.

The style-sheets `.CSS` are where the meat of this project lie. You'll find a regular `overy-orange.css` and a minified `overly-orange.min.css`.
